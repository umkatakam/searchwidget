searchwidget
============

GWT search widget
 
This search widget can be used to display multiple groups of search results at once. For e.g. if you search for "ne" you could implement a service to return results in groups, like cities, names, countries etc. This widget would then display these results in groups.

Like this (sorry for the bad art)
